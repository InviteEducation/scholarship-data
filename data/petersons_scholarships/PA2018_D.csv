Granted, our AIs don’t go around on their own; they go around through us–in our pockets, in our cars, in our homes. From the Google search engine, to personal assistants like Siri, Cortana, and Google Assistant, to our own Facebook feed. We not only tolerate artificial intelligence, but we inadvertently depend on it with our studies, work, personal relationships, and consumer decisions. As AI becomes an increasingly indispensable part of human existence, we will be confronted with a looming issue. That of ethics. Artificial Intelligence promises business, technological, and healthcare improvements, but it also paves the way for advanced warfare and countless socio-economic issues. There is a thin line between useful and harmful, if there is even a line at all. Especially considering that an action need not be harmful to have harmful consequences. It seems to us at 365 Data Science that the pillars of the debate about ethics in AI are made up of four concepts: autonomy, trust, power, and accountability.

By posting your questions, you're not only getting personalized information, insight, and advice from industry experts, but you're surfacing the answers to questions thousands of other students like you also want to know (aka killing two birds!). The winner will be selected based on question quality and financial need. You must ask college and/or career-related questions that require an answer from an actual human being! In other words, post more subjective questions. Don't post a question like ""what is an architect?"" because the answer can easily be found with a quick Google search. Instead, ask something like ""what was the hardest part about becoming an architect?"". This is the type of question that any architect can answer, and their answers will provide you with a ton of valuable insight into what their career path was like! If you ask questions you can find the answer to with a 10 second Google search, or off-topic questions (e.g. ""why is the sky blue?"") they will be removed from the site and you will not be considered when we choose a scholarship winner! Before you post your questions, it's a good idea to search CareerVillage.org first to make sure your question hasn't already been asked and answered. ""Duplicate"" questions usually get removed by moderators. But fear not: it's rare that two students ask for the exact same piece of advice. Don't have questions? Come on, everyone has questions!
